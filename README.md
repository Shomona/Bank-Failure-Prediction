# Bank-Failure-Prediction

Assignment: Preventing Bank Failures
From 2008 - 2011, 430 banks and thrifts went into receivership, with about an $80bn net impact on the FDIC Deposit Insurance fund
As of 2011Q4, the FDIC’s problem bank list had 813 institutions with total assets $320bn

Modeling: Use the sample data to answer:
• What was the biggest bank at the end of 2009?
• What trends do you observe in net chargeoffs over time?
• Is there a correlation between level of profitability of a bank’s investments in
securities (here measured by fair value of investments over cost basis) and
bank failure?
• What are the top two predictors of bank failure?
• Which banks are most likely to fail in the near future (and why)?
